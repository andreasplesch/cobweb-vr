# cobweb-vr

## ideas

* use Layers, side by side view ports, second viewpoint offset by IPS from first viewpoints, probably use transform for offset, and around that transform for rotation, tilt, and around that transform for pose translation.

* prototype ? : could perhaps inlcude swtich into vr mode
